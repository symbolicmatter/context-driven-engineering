# Contributing to Context-Driven Engineering

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This repository is not a generic open-source project.
It is a **reference body of thought and practice**.

Contributions are welcome, but they are expected to respect the intent,
coherence, and conceptual rigor of the work.

---

## What This Repository Is

Contributions should strengthen CDE as a conceptual framework,
not turn this repository into a prescriptive methodology or starter kit.

This repository exists to:

- Articulate Context-Driven Engineering (CDE) clearly
- Explore its implications in practice
- Provide concrete, opinionated examples
- Serve as a reference for humans and AI agents

It is **not** intended to:

- Become a framework
- Accumulate unrelated patterns
- Track trends in tools or technologies

---

## Types of Contributions Welcome

We welcome contributions that:

- Clarify existing documents
- Improve precision or reduce ambiguity
- Strengthen examples without simplifying intent
- Surface tensions or trade-offs explicitly
- Fix errors or inconsistencies

We are especially interested in contributions that improve:

- Conceptual clarity
- Internal consistency
- Practical applicability

---

## Design Worldviews

CDE itself is worldview-agnostic.

However, this repository includes an **Object-Centric Design Worldview**
as a worked example.

When contributing to documents or examples that explicitly adopt a worldview:

- Respect that worldview
- Do not dilute it “for accessibility”
- Do not replace it with generic service-oriented thinking

If you disagree with a worldview, raise it explicitly in discussion.

---

## How to Contribute

1. Open an issue describing:
   - What you want to change
   - Why it improves clarity or rigor
2. Make small, focused pull requests
3. Reference existing documents explicitly
4. Explain assumptions when introducing new material

Large conceptual changes typically start as discussion.

---

## What We Will Push Back On

Expect pushback on contributions that:

- Introduce vague or fashionable terminology
- Optimize for popularity over coherence
- Add abstractions without clear responsibility
- Reframe ideas purely in technical or tooling terms

This is intentional.

Conceptual integrity matters more than consensus.

---

## AI-Generated Contributions

AI-assisted contributions are allowed.

However:
- You are responsible for the intent and correctness
- Generated text must be reviewed and understood
- Contributions that read as generic AI output will be rejected

AI is a tool, not an author.

---

## Tone and Conduct

Be precise.
Be respectful.
Assume intelligence and good intent.

Strong opinions are welcome.
Personal attacks are not.

## Final Note

If you find yourself thinking:
> “This would be easier if we simplified it…”

Pause.

The difficulty is often the point.
